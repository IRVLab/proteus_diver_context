# proteus_diver_context

This is the diver context module for PROTEUS, required for using ACVS. This module expects input from a darknet_ros diver detector, and makes requests from a deeplabcut based pose estimator (github.umn.edu/IRVLab/deeplabcut_ros).

### This is research code. As much as I would love to be able to develop it until it's extremely stable and easy to use, that's simply not the way that PhDs work. Please do your best to figure out what's going on inside this code, and if you have problems that you can't resolve, submit an issue/email Michael.
